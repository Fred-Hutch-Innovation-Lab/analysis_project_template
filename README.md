# Analysis project template

This repository is meant to serve as a template for projects. The goal is to align structure and enforce good practices. Read the [FHIL SOPs](https://fred-hutch-innovation-lab.github.io/SOPs/) for more guidance.

The structure is inspired by the [gin-tonic](https://gin-tonic.netlify.app/standard/) project and the file naming conventions of [The Turing Way](https://book.the-turing-way.org/reproducible-research/rdm/rdm-storage#rr-rdm-storage-organisation).
